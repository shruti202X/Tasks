# Tasks

Just a small Python application to keep track of tasks.

# TODO

- merge tasks (done)
- reverse merging of tasks
- make one task as subtask of another
- display timeline
- allow message editing
- move tasks no longer in focus to archive folder
- make a pip package to install this (optional)
